Can you blow my whistle baby

whistle baby

Let me know

Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it

And we start real slow

You just put your lips together

And you come real close

Can you blow my whistle baby

whistle baby

Here we go 



Look, I'm betting you like bebop

And I'm betting you love creep mode

And I'm betting you like girls that give
love to girls

And stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty your honor

That's just how we live in my genre

Who in the hell done paved the road wider

There's only one flo, and one rida

I'm a damn shame
