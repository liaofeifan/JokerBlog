### English Self Introduction

Good morning sir/madam:

My name is WangZhizhou. And I am 24 years old. My hometown is ShanXi province. My parents are all teachers.
Thanks to the cultivation of them.

I studied in Nanchang University which locate in JiangXi province for my bechlor degree. And now, I am a
 master cadididate in Tianjin University. During the two study years, I participated in two projects as my 
 resume reads. For me, the most important one is the Parking detecting system on yellow grid area. Through this
 project, I learned to use multi-thread technologies to collect datum from multiple hareware devices, such as
  IP Cameras, Laser ranging finder and radar speed measuring instrument. I also eliminated a bug in the first 
  project about memory leak. The process is tough, eventually, I make it fixed!.
  
After those two projects, I mastered some skills about c/c++ programming technologies. I can use MFC to create
  samll desktop application on windows platform. I also learned some knowledge about OpenCV image processing library.
  This is an open source library written by c++ programming language. I use it to do my graduation project.
  
  That's All. Thanks for your attention. Thank you!
