# Brief Introduction 

Hello, I'm Wang Zhizhou, a single dog and a coder. Right now, I'm working on iOS development. I wanted to have my own blog early, but I didn't find simple tools and methods. Now, I found it. And this blog is powered by `MkDocs` which is very simple and concise, I love it. With the help of `Read the Docs`ï¼Œyou can publish you blog on the internet for sharing you mind. Oh, maybe you should have a `GitHub` account for you blog source repo. Trust me, you can also have your own blog in half an hour.


 I was born in 1991. Yes, the Linux operation system was born in the same year. And I like computer, though I'm not top experts. I just like it, and want to do something with computer, I enjoy that feeling.
